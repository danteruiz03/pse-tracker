Sample application that gets Philippine Stock Exchange Data from https://pselookup.vrymel.com/api/stocks.
To test on local do:

### `npm start`

for the front-end and then do:

### `npm run server`

Which will open a mock backend (https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) on port 5000 and will query data from the db.json file in the root folder.
